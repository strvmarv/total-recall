# total-recall

**Multi-tiered memory and knowledge base for TUI coding assistants.**

Your AI coding tool forgets everything. total-recall doesn't.

A cross-platform plugin that gives Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenCode, Cline, Cursor, and Hermes persistent, semantically searchable memory with a hierarchical knowledge base — backed by local SQLite + vector embeddings, zero external dependencies.

---

## The Problem

Every TUI coding assistant has the same gap:

- **No tiering** — all memories treated equally, leading to context bloat or information loss
- **Tool-locked** — switching between Claude Code and Copilot means starting from scratch
- **No knowledge base** — can't ingest your docs and have them retrieved when relevant
- **No semantic search** — memories retrieved by filename, not by meaning
- **No observability** — no way to know if memory is helping or just noise

---

## The Solution

total-recall introduces a three-tier memory model: **Hot** memories (up to 50 entries) are auto-injected into every prompt so your most important context is always present. **Warm** memories (up to 10K entries) are retrieved semantically — when you ask about authentication, relevant auth memories surface automatically. **Cold** storage is unlimited hierarchical knowledge base: ingest your docs, README files, API references, and architecture notes, and they're retrieved when relevant.

The knowledge base ingests entire directories — source trees, documentation folders, design specs — and chunks them semantically with heading-aware Markdown parsing and regex-based code parsing. Every chunk is embedded with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions, runs locally via ONNX) so retrieval is purely semantic, no keyword matching required.

Platform support is via MCP (Model Context Protocol), which means total-recall works with any MCP-compatible tool. Dedicated importers for Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, and Hermes mean your existing memories migrate automatically on first run. An eval framework lets you measure retrieval quality, run benchmarks, and compare configuration changes before committing them.

---

## Installation

### Self-Install (Paste Into Any AI Coding Assistant)

> Install the total-recall memory plugin: fetch and follow the instructions at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strvmarv/total-recall/main/INSTALL.md

That's it. Your AI assistant will read the instructions and install total-recall for its platform.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin install total-recall@strvmarv-total-recall-marketplace
```

Or if the marketplace isn't registered:

```
/plugin marketplace add strvmarv/total-recall-marketplace
/plugin install total-recall@strvmarv-total-recall-marketplace
```

### npm (Any MCP-Compatible Tool)

```bash
npm install -g @strvmarv/total-recall
```

Then add to your tool's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "total-recall": {
      "command": "total-recall"
    }
  }
}
```

This works with **Copilot CLI**, **OpenCode**, **Cline**, **Cursor**, **Hermes**, and any other MCP-compatible tool.

> **Note:** `npx -y @strvmarv/total-recall` does not work due to an [npm bug](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3753) with scoped package binaries. Use the global install (`total-recall` command) instead.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strvmarv/total-recall.git
cd total-recall
npm install && npm run build
```

### First Session

On first `session_start`, total-recall initializes `~/.total-recall/` with a SQLite database and loads the bundled embedding model (included in package, no download needed). Every session then runs:

1. **Import sync** — scans Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, and Hermes memory directories, deduplicates and imports new entries
2. **Warm sweep** — if overdue, demotes stale warm entries to cold based on decay
3. **Project docs ingest** — detects README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/ in cwd and ingests into a project-scoped KB collection
4. **Smoke test** — on version change, runs a 22-query benchmark to validate retrieval quality
5. **Warm-to-hot promotion** — semantically searches warm tier for entries relevant to the current project and promotes them to hot
6. **Hot tier assembly** — enforces token budget, evicts lowest-decay entries, returns hot tier as injectable context
7. **Config snapshot** — captures current config for retrieval quality tracking
8. **Tier summary** — counts entries across all tiers and KB collections for the startup announcement.
9. **Hint generation** — surfaces high-value warm memories (corrections, preferences, frequently accessed) as actionable one-liners for the agent.
10. **Session continuity** — computes time since last session for contextual framing.
11. **Regression detection** — compares retrieval metrics against previous config snapshot and alerts if quality has dropped.

## Architecture

```
MCP Server (Node.js/TypeScript)
├── Always Loaded: SQLite + vec, MCP Tools, Event Logger
├── Lazy Loaded: ONNX Embedder, Compactor, Ingestor
└── Host Importers: Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Cursor, Cline, OpenCode, Hermes

Tiers:
  Hot (50 entries)  → auto-injected every prompt
  Warm (10K entries) → semantic search per query
  Cold (unlimited)   → hierarchical KB retrieval
```

**Data flow:**

1. `store` — write a memory, assign tier, embed, persist
2. `search` — embed query, vector search across all tiers, return ranked results
3. `compact` — decay scores, promote hot→warm, demote warm→cold
4. `ingest` — chunk files, embed chunks, store in cold tier with metadata

All state lives in `~/.total-recall/total-recall.db`. The embedding model is bundled with the package. No network calls required.

## Extending

### Adding a New Host Tool

Implement the `HostImporter` interface. It requires four methods: `detect()` to check if the tool is present, `scan()` to report what's available, `importMemories()` to migrate existing memories, and `importKnowledge()` to migrate knowledge files. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a full example.

### Adding a New Content Type

Content types (`"memory"` and `"knowledge"`) are defined in `src/types.ts` as the `ContentType` union. Each tier has separate tables per content type (e.g., `hot_memories`, `hot_knowledge`). To add a new content type, add it to the `ContentType` union, create the corresponding tier tables in `src/db/schema.ts`, and update `ALL_TABLE_PAIRS`.

### Adding a New Chunking Parser

Implement the `Chunk[]`-returning parser interface and register it in `src/ingestion/chunker.ts` alongside the existing Markdown and code parsers. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the interface definition.

## Built With & Inspired By

### [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by [obra](https://github.com/obra)

total-recall's plugin architecture, skill format, hook system, multi-platform wrapper pattern, and development philosophy are directly inspired by and modeled after the **superpowers** plugin. superpowers demonstrated that a zero-dependency, markdown-driven skill system could fundamentally improve how AI coding assistants behave — total-recall extends that same philosophy to memory and knowledge management.

Specific patterns we learned from superpowers:

- **SKILL.md format** with YAML frontmatter and trigger-condition-focused descriptions
- **SessionStart hooks** for injecting core behavior at session start
- **Multi-platform wrappers** (`.claude-plugin/`, `.copilot-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.opencode/`)
- **Subagent architecture** for isolated, focused task execution
- **Zero-dependency philosophy** — no external services, no API keys, no cloud
- **Two-stage review pattern** for quality assurance

If you're building plugins for TUI coding assistants, start with [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). It's the foundation this ecosystem needs.
